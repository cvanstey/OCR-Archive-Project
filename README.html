# Digital Archive Processing Stack

## 1. Local Development (PyCharm)
- Write and test `.py` scripts.
- Use libraries such as **PyMuPDF**, **Pillow**, **pytesseract**, **pandas**, and others.
- These scripts function as tools for:
  - extraction  
  - OCR  
  - preprocessing  
  - name and address recognition  
  - image detection and enhancement  
  - data structuring  

---

## 2. Version Control & Storage (GitHub)
- Push all scripts, assets, notebooks, and documentation to GitHub.
- Serves as the **source of truth**:
  - versioning  
  - collaboration  
  - sharing  
  - backup  

---

## 3. Interactive Processing & Demos (Google Colab)
- Pull scripts directly from GitHub into a Colab notebook (`.ipynb`).
- Run workflows interactively:
  - tweak parameters  
  - inspect intermediate outputs  
  - test on small or medium-sized datasets  
- Create **temporary demos** using Colab for rapid testing or demonstration.

---

## 4. Web Deployment & Sharing (Gradio / Hugging Face Spaces)
- **Temporary Demo:**  
  Create quick interactive Gradio apps inside Colab.
- **Permanent Demo:**  
  Deploy full interactive tools on **Hugging Face Spaces** using Gradio.
- Allows anyone to use your tools **without installing anything locally** (browser-based access).
